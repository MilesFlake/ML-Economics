#GDP Forecasting with Machine Learning

GDP Forecast and Comparison
---------------------------
This script compares historical GDP data for the U.S., China, and Germany,
calculates growth rates, and predicts future values using linear regression.

Data source: World Bank GDP data (loaded from GDP.csv)
Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy

In the future I hope to add r and r^2 values to see how well the data points corelate.
